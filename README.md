### Introduction

In this work, we propose an end-to-end one-stage Transformer-based framework for Mapping, termed Trans4Map. Our egocentric-to-allocentric mapping process includes three steps: (1) the efficient transformer extracts the contextual features from a batch of egocentric images; (2) the proposed Bidirectional Allocentric Memory (BAM) module projects egocentric features into the allocentric memory; (3) the map decoder parses the accumulated memory and predicts the top-down semantic segmentation map.

More detailed can be found in our [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06205.pdf) paper.


### Installation
#### To create conda env:
    conda create -n Trans4Map python=3.7
    conda activate Trans4Map
    cd /path/to/Trans4Map
    pip install -r requirements.txt
 To get RGBD renderings in Matterport3D dataset, we need to install [Habitat-sim](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim) and [Habitat-lab](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-lab).
 To ensure consistency with our working environmentï¼Œplease install the following version Habitat-sim == 0.1.5 and Habitat-lab == 0.1.5.

### Datasets
You can prepare the training and test dataset in the same way as [SMNet](https://github.com/vincentcartillier/Semantic-MapNet).
* ```data/paths.json``` has the given trajectories which are manually recorded by SMNet.
* The semantic top-down ground truth are also available : [GT](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aM9vfDckY6K81mrVhVLmEX5rKZ2B1Q5r?usp=sharing), please place them under ```data/semmap```.
* Our project is working with [Matterport3D](https://niessner.github.io/Matterport/) dataset and [Replica](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Replica-Dataset) dataset, please download them and place them under ```data/mp3d or data/replica```.

### Training and Evaluation
To train our Trans4Map with different backbones, run:
    
    python train.py 
To generate the test result, run the following code:

    python build_test_date_feature.py
    python test.py
To obtain the mIOU and mBF1, run:

    python eval/eval.py
    python eval/eval_bfscore.py
